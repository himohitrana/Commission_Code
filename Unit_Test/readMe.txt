1. The code defines several test methods for different scenarios related to the input file and external API responses.
2. testEmptyInputFile(): This test case verifies that when the input file is empty, the output is also empty. It runs the command to execute the currency.php script with the empty input file and asserts that the output is empty.
3. testInvalidInputFile(): This test case checks the behavior when the input file does not exist. It expects an exception of type \Exception with a specific error message to be thrown. It runs the command with the nonexistent input file and expects the exception to be thrown.
4. testInvalidBinResults(): This test case ensures that if the BIN lookup API returns invalid results (empty response), the output contains the string 'error!'. It runs the command with the input file that triggers invalid BIN results and checks if the output contains the expected string.
5. testInvalidExchangeRatesApiResults(): This test case tests the scenario where the exchange rates API returns invalid results (empty response). It verifies that the output contains the string 'error!' when this happens. The command is executed with the input file that triggers invalid API results, and the output is checked for the expected string.
6. testInvalidCurrency(): This test case checks the behavior when an invalid currency is encountered. It expects the output to be empty. The command is executed with the input file that triggers an invalid currency, and the output is asserted to be empty.
7. testValidInput(): This test case covers the scenario of valid input where the script should produce the expected output. It runs the command with the valid input file and compares the output with the expected output string.
8. testValidInputWithNoCommission(): This test case verifies the behavior when valid input is provided but the commission rate is zero. It expects the output to contain all zero values. The command is executed with the input file containing no commission, and the output is checked against the expected output string.
9. runCommand(): This helper method takes a variable number of arguments representing the command to be executed. It runs the command as a separate process using the Symfony\Component\Process\Process class. If the process is successful, it returns the trimmed output; otherwise, it throws an exception with an appropriate error message.
